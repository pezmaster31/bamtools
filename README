I. Introduction:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BamTools provides both a programmer's API and an end-user's toolkit for handling
BAM files.

----------------------------------------
Ia. The API:
----------------------------------------

The API consists of 2 main modules: BamReader and BamWriter. As you would
expect, BamReader provides read-access to BAM files, while BamWriter handles
writing data to BAM files. BamReader provides the interface for random-access
(jumping) in a BAM file, as well as generating BAM index files.

BamMultiReader is an extra module that allows you to manage multiple open BAM
files for reading. It provides some validation & bookkeeping under the hood to
keep all files sync'ed up for you.

Additional files used by the API:

 - BamAlignment.* : implements the BamAlignment data structure

 - BamAux.h       : contains various constants, data structures and utility
                    methods used throught the API.

 - BamIndex.*     : implements both the standard BAM format index (".bai") as
                    well as a new BamTools-specific index (".bti").

 - BGZF.*         : contains our implementation of the Broad Institute's BGZF
                    compression format.

----------------------------------------
Ib. The Toolkit:
----------------------------------------

If you've been using the BamTools since the early days, you'll notice that our
'toy' API examples (BamConversion, BamDump, BamTrim,...) are now gone.  We have
dumped these in favor of a suite of small utilities that we hope both
developers and end-users find useful:

usage: bamtools [--help] COMMAND [ARGS]

Available bamtools commands:

        convert         Converts between BAM and a number of other formats
        count           Prints number of alignments in BAM file(s)
        coverage        Prints coverage statistics from the input BAM file
        filter          Filters BAM file(s) by user-specified criteria

II. Usage :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** General usage information - perhaps explain common terms, point to SAM/BAM
spec, etc **

----------------------------------------
IIa. The API
----------------------------------------

The API, as noted above, contains 2 main modules - BamReader & BamWriter - for
dealing with BAM files. Alignment data is made available through the
BamAlignment data structure.

A simple (read-only) scenario for accessing BAM data would look like the
following:

        // open our BamReader
        BamReader reader;
        reader.Open("someData.bam", "someData.bam.bai");

        // define our region of interest
        // in this example: bases 0-500 on the reference "chrX"
        int id = reader.GetReferenceID("chrX");
        BamRegion region(id, 0, id, 500);
        reader.SetRegion(region);

        // iterate through alignments in this region,
        // ignoring alignments with a MQ below some cutoff
        BamAlignment al;
        while ( reader.GetNextAlignment(al) ) {
            if ( al.MapQuality >= 50 )
                // do something
        }

        // close the reader
        reader.Close();

To use this API in your application, you simply need to do 3 things:

    1 - Drop the BamTools API files somewhere the compiler can find them.

    2 - Import BamTools API with the following lines of code
        #include "BamReader.h"     // (or "BamMultiReader.h") as needed
        #include "BamWriter.h"     // as needed
        using namespace BamTools;  // all of BamTools classes/methods live in
                                   // this namespace

    3 - Link with '-lz' ('l' as in Lima) to access ZLIB compression library
        (For MSVC users, I can provide you modified zlib headers - just contact
        me if needed).

See any included programs and Makefile for more specific compiling/usage
examples. See comments in the header files for more detailed API documentation.

----------------------------------------
IIb. The Toolkit
----------------------------------------

BamTools provides a small, but powerful suite of command-line utility programs
for manipulating and querying BAM files for data.

--------------------
Input/Output
--------------------

All BamTools utilities handle I/O operations using a common set of arguments.
These include:

 -in <BAM file>

The input BAM files(s).

    If a tool accepts multiple BAM files as input, each file gets its own "-in"
    option on the command line. If no "-in" is provided, the tool will attempt
    to read BAM data from stdin.

    To read a single BAM file, use a single "-in" option:
    > bamtools *tool* -in myData1.bam ...ARGS...

    To read multiple BAM files, use multiple "-in" options:
    > bamtools *tool* -in myData1.bam -in myData2.bam ...ARGS...

    To read from stdin (if supported), omit the "-in" option:
    > bamtools *tool* ...ARGS...

  -out <BAM file>

The output BAM file.

    If a tool outputs a result BAM file, specify the filename using this option.
    If none is provided, the tool will typically write to stdout.

    *Note: Not all tools output BAM data (e.g. count, header, etc.)

 -region <REGION>

A region of interest. See below for accepted 'REGION string' formats.

    Many of the tools accept this option, which allows a user to only consider
    alignments that overlap this region (whether counting, filtering, merging,
    etc.).

    An alignment is considered to overlap a region if any part of the alignments
    intersects the left/right boundaries. Thus, a 50bp alignment at position 70
    will overlap a region beginning at position 100.

    REGION string format
    ----------------------
    A proper REGION string can be formatted like any of the following examples:
        where 'chr1' is the name of a reference (not its ID)and '' is any valid
        integer position within that reference.

    To read
    chr1               - only alignments on (entire) reference 'chr1'
    chr1:500           - only alignments overlapping the region starting at
                         chr1:500 and continuing to the end of chr1
    chr1:500..1000     - only alignments overlapping the region starting at
                         chr1:500 and continuing to chr1:1000
    chr1:500..chr3:750 - only alignments overlapping the region starting at
                         chr1:500 and continuing to chr3:750. This 'spanning'
                         region assumes that the reference specified as the
                         right boundary will occur somewhere in the file after
                         the left boundary. On a sorted BAM, a REGION of
                         'chr4:500..chr2:1500' will produce undefined
                         (incorrect) results.  So don't do it. :)

    *Note: Most of the tools that accept a REGION string will perform without an
           index file, but typically at great cost to performance (having to
           plow through the entire file until the region of interest is found).
           For optimum speed, be sure that index files are available for your
           data.

 -forceCompression

Force compression of BAM output.

    When tools are piped together (see details below), the default behavior is
    to turn off compression. This can greatly increase performance when the data
    does not have to be constantly decompressed and recompressed. This is
    ignored any time an output BAM file is specified using "-out".

--------------------
Piping
--------------------

Many of the tools in BamTools can be chained together by piping.  Any tool that
accepts stdin can be piped into, and any that can output stdout can be piped
from. For example:

> bamtools filter -in data1.bam -in data2.bam -mapQuality ">50" | bamtools count

will give a count of all alignments in your 2 BAM files with a mapQuality of
greater than 50. And of course, any tool writing to stdout can be piped into
other utilities.

--------------------
The Tools
--------------------

    convert         Converts between BAM and a number of other formats
    count           Prints number of alignments in BAM file(s)

  *****************
  * Filter Script *
  *****************

The BamTools filter tool allows you to use an external filter script to define
complex filtering behavior.  This script uses what I'm calling properties,
filters, and a rule - all implemented in a JSON syntax.

  ** Properties **

A 'property' is a typical JSON entry of the form:

    "propertyName" : "value"

Here are the property names that BamTools will recognize:

    alignmentFlag
    cigar
    insertSize
    isDuplicate
    isFailedQC
    isFirstMate
    isMapped
    isMateMapped
    isMateReverseStrand
    isPaired
    isPrimaryAlignment
    isProperPair
    isReverseStrand
    isSecondMate
    mapQuality
    matePosition
    mateReference
    name
    position
    queryBases
    reference
    tag

For properties with boolean values, use the words "true" or "false".
For example,

   "isMapped" : "true"

will keep only alignments that are flagged as 'mapped'.

For properties with numeric values, use the desired number with optional
comparison operators ( >, >=, <, <=, !). For example,

    "mapQuality" : ">=75"

will keep only alignments with mapQuality greater than or equal to 75.

If you're familiar with JSON, you know that integers can be bare (without
quotes). However, if you a comparison operator, be sure to enclose in quotes.

For string-based properties, the above operators are available.  In addition,
 you can also use some basic pattern-matching operators.  For example,

    "reference" : "ALU*"  // reference starts with 'ALU'
    "name" : "*foo"       // name ends with 'foo'
    "cigar" : "*D*"       // cigar contains a 'D' anywhere

Notes -
The reference property refers to the reference name, not the BAM reference
numeric ID.

The tag property has an extra layer, so that the syntax will look like this:

    "tag" : "XX:value"

where XX is the 2-letter SAM/BAM tag and value is, well, the value.
Comparison operators can still apply to values, so tag properties of:

    "tag" : "AS:>60"
    "tag" : "RG:foo*"

are perfectly valid.

 ** Filters **

A 'filter' is a JSON container of properties that will be AND-ed together. For
example,

{
   "reference" : "chr1",
   "mapQuality" : ">50",
   "tag" : "NM:<4"
}

would result in an output BAM file containing only alignments from chr1 with a
mapQuality >50 and edit distance of less than 4.

A single, unnamed filter like this is the minimum necessary for a complete
filter script.  Save this file and use as the -script parameter and you should
be all set.

Moving on to more potent filtering...

You can also define multiple filters.
To do so, you just need to use the "filters" keyword along with JSON array
syntax, like this:

{
   "filters" :
      [
        {
          "reference" : "chr1",
          "mapQuality" : ">50"
        },
        {
          "reference" : "chr1",
          "isReverseStrand" : "true"
        }
      ]
}

These filters will be (inclusive) OR-ed together by default. So you'd get a
resulting BAM with only alignments from chr1 that had either mapQuality >50 or
on the reverse strand (or both).

 ** Rule **

Alternatively to anonymous OR-ed filters, you can also provide what I've called
a "rule". By giving each filter an "id", using this "rule" keyword you can
describe boolean relationships between your filter sets.

Available rule operators:

    &   // and
    |   // or
    !   // not

This might sound a little fuzzy at this point, so let's get back to an example:

{
   "filters" :
      [
        {
          "id" : "filter1",
          "reference" : "chr1",
          "mapQuality" : ">50"
        },
        {
          "id" : "filter2",
          "reference" : "chr1",
          "isReverseStrand" : "true"
        },
        {
          "id" : "filter3",
          "reference" : "chr1",
          "queryBases" : "AGCT*"
        }
      ],

   "rule" : " (filter1 | filter2) & !filter3 "
}

In this case, we would only retain aligments that passed filter 1 OR filter 2,
AND also NOT filter 3.

These are dummy examples, and don't make much sense as an actual query case. But
hopefully this serves an adequate primer to get you started and discover the
potential flexibility here.

                      [-out <filename> | [-forceCompression]] [-region <REGION>]

Input & Output:
  -in <BAM filename>                the input BAM file(s)
  -out <BAM filename>               the output BAM file
  -forceCompression                 if results are sent to stdout (like when
                                       piping to another tool), default behavior
                                       is to leave output uncompressed. Use this
                                       flag to override and force compression
  -region <REGION>                  genomic region. See README for more details

----------
random
----------

Description: grab a random subset of alignments.

Usage: bamtools random [-in <filename> -in <filename> ...]
                       [-out <filename>] [-forceCompression] [-n]
                       [-region <REGION>]

Input & Output:
  -in <BAM filename>                the input BAM file [stdin]
  -out <BAM filename>               the output BAM file [stdout]
  -forceCompression                 if results are sent to stdout (like when
                                       piping to another tool), default behavior
                                       is to leave output uncompressed. Use this
                                       flag to override and force compression
  -region <REGION>                  only pull random alignments from within this
                                       genomic region. Index file is
                                       recommended for better performance, and
                                       is used automatically if it exists. See
                                       'bamtools help index' for more details
                                       on creating one

Settings:
  -n <count>                        number of alignments to grab. Note that no
                                       duplicate checking is performed [10000]

----------
sort
----------

Description: sorts a BAM file.

Usage: bamtools sort [-in <filename>] [-out <filename>] [sortOptions]

Input & Output:
  -in <BAM filename>                the input BAM file [stdin]
  -out <BAM filename>               the output BAM file [stdout]

Sorting Methods:
  -byname                           sort by alignment name

Memory Settings:
  -n <count>                        max number of alignments per tempfile
                                       [10000]
  -mem <Mb>                         max memory to use [1024]

----------
split
----------

Description: splits a BAM file on user-specified property, creating a new BAM
output file for each value found.

Usage: bamtools split [-in <filename>] [-stub <filename stub>]
                      < -mapped | -paired | -reference | -tag <TAG> >

Input & Output:
  -in <BAM filename>                the input BAM file [stdin]
  -stub <filename stub>             prefix stub for output BAM files (default
                                       behavior is to use input filename,
                                       without .bam extension, as stub). If
                                       input is stdin and no stub provided, a
                                       timestamp is generated as the stub.

Split Options:
  -mapped                           split mapped/unmapped alignments
  -paired                           split single-end/paired-end alignments
  -reference                        split alignments by reference
  -tag <tag name>                   splits alignments based on all values of TAG
                                       encountered (i.e. -tag RG creates a BAM
                                       file for each read group in original
                                       BAM file)

----------
stats
----------

Description: prints general alignment statistics.

Usage: bamtools stats [-in <filename> -in <filename> ...] [statsOptions]

Input & Output:
  -in <BAM filename>                the input BAM file [stdin]

Additional Stats:
  -insert                           summarize insert size data
